# Data-Wrangling-Assignment-1-and-2
Data Wrangling assignments (Python/Jupyter): end-to-end data cleaning, feature engineering, and ML modelling — Song Popularity regression + multi-table Baseball prediction.

# Data Wrangling Assignments (Python / Jupyter)

This repository contains my individual work for **Data Wrangling**:
- **Assignment 1**: Song popularity regression (wrangling + linear regression) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Assignment 2**: Multi-table wrangling from a real database (Baseball history) + ML model (baseline + simple model) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## What’s inside

### Assignment 1 — Song Popularity (Regression)
Goal: Explore, clean, transform, engineer features, and build/evaluate a **linear regression** model to predict song popularity.

**Key steps**
- EDA (distributions, correlations, missingness)
- Outlier detection & handling
- Missing value imputation
- Encoding (if categorical fields exist)
- (Optional) transformations (log/Box-Cox) + binning
- Train/test split (70/30)
- Scaling / feature engineering
- Linear regression + evaluation (metrics + discussion)

### Assignment 2 — Baseball History (Multi-table Prediction)
Goal: Extract and join data from **≥ 3 tables**, build a tabular dataset, wrangle it, then train:
- a naïve baseline model
- a simple ML model  
…and compare performance.

**Key steps**
- Problem formulation (define target + features)
- Multi-table joins/aggregation + feature creation (transaction/time-series where relevant)
- Cleansing + transformation
- Baseline vs model evaluation
- Report + reflection section
